The program works using DNN (deep neural network) to train and learn how to recognize animal photos.
1)Put your animal images you wish to train the program in assets folder. The name of the subfolder in assets is used as the label of the images contained in it! Unzip assets and test .zip files contained in those folders.
2)In test folder there are images used for testing the program to see if it works correctly and there is a monkey folder in it used for retraining the program to learn how to recognize monkeys. You can add whatever animal you wish for program to learn and recognize.
3)When starting the program will scan all the images in assets folder and train the DNN to recognize those pictures. It will take some time for program to start. 
4)Retraining the DNN can be done by clicking [train model] button on MainWindow where u can select images and declare the Label of those images(e.g. monkey label with selected monkey pictures)

5)Making prediction is done by clicking on [select image] button, choosing an image and then clicking on [Predict] button. The program will analyze the photo and put a prediction based on the images used for training.
THE MORE IMAGES THE MORE PRECISE THE PROGRAM IS!!!

IMPORANT!
Do not retrain the model if u havent predicted an animal image first. It will cause the program to crash for some reason.

This is not a file for your profesors delete it before sending the project.
